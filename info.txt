	Hey!
-----------

Welcome to the info text file for the Jatsby (Web) Framework!
Here's the gist:

Jatsby, like Foundation, PureCSS, and Bootstrap, is an outline of sorts for people to make awesome websites with.
What makes Jatsby different from the others is that maximum compatibility with web browsers and operating systems isn't really on top of the priority list.
What *is* on the top is compatibility with screen sizes. Screen size information was gathered for today's most-popular devices to determine the best possible
	breakpoints for the best experience possible.
Jatsby doesn't use a grid system, and has three CSS files, fewer than virtually every web framework out there, and they of course each have their purpose:

----------
mobile.css
----------
- 300px - 599px
- Covers: iPhone, Nexus 5, virtually all smartphones at least in portrait view

----------
tablet.css
----------
- 600px - 899px
- Covers: iPad (inc. Air, Mini), Nexus 7, Nexus 10, virtually all tablets in portrait view


-----------
desktop.css
-----------
- 900px - 1200px & 1201px +
- two breakpoints (900+, 1201+)
	- Tablet Landscape
		- Covers: iPad (inc. Air, Mini), Nexus 7, Nexus 10, virtually all tablets in landscape view
		- Also Covers: MacBook Pro 13", Surface Pro 3, virtually all laptop and desktop computers
	- Desktop
		- For desktop-specific CSS
		- ie, :hover effects, sidebars
		- While many desktop and laptop computers these days have touch screens, mouse input still exists!

	The Future
------------------

This section of the info.txt is for taking note of some expected future changes to the Jatsby Framework.

By version 1.0, we expect to have all of our CSS "modules" (pre-made code for things like buttons) completed and bundled with Jatsby.
We also expect to have a *much* better website (http://jatsby.com) as we find more time to work on it so that it better-showcases
what the Jatsby Framework can do.

Here's a list of some of the modules we're working on:

- buttons
- headers
- footers
- graphs
- "sections" (more on this later)

We encourage you to be active in the development of Jatsby by helping us find "bugs" (we know, it's technically not programming...), making
suggestions, or just saying hello! We do ask that you remember this is a beta release, and that there's sure to be some "stupid" mistakes.
Go easy on us!
