The Jatsby Web Framework
========================

About
------
The Jatsby Website Framework is a simple way to create webpages and websites. It's a pure website framework, so unlike Bootstrap or Skel, it doesn't use JavaScript or jQuery *at all*. And with one HTML file and three CSS files, Jatsby makes the perfect framework for those just starting out with web design.

Speaking of those just starting out...
--------------------------------------
In progress is a simple website guide to help get your website off the ground. No ETA, unfortunately, but it'll likely be out before 2015!

Inside Jatsby
-------------
Inside Jatsby, you'll find three folders: docs, extras and template. As you might have guessed, "docs" is where you'll find, well, *docs*! This includes licenses and eventually, that website guide. The "extras" folder is where you'll (in a future release) find some pre-made goodies, like buttons, headers and even graphs- all made with pure CSS. It's the other part of the framework, and it's a part of Jatsby v0.5 alongside Lato, Jatsby's "signature font". As for "template", that's where you'll find the one HTML and three CSS files that will eventually become your website! It's responsive and ready for your code!

The idea is that you'll one day be able to bring code from "extras" into your website in the "template" folder, and then simply move and rename the template folder for use with Apache, etc.
