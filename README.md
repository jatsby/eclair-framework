The Jatsby Framework is a simple web "UI Framework" for creating elegant webpages and experimenting with your latest designs. It comes with four breakpoints, a simple-but-effective reset CSS block called Rasa (available standalone), awesome fonts, and a diverse color palette.

It's designed with Chrome, FireFox and Safari in mind and meant to suppliment client-side Js frameworks that lack a proper UI element, like Ember and Angular.


Breakpoints
------------
Jatsby includes four simple breakpoints for making your website responsive. And if responsive isn't on the agenda, simply stick to main.css' 320px breakpoint.

main.css - for @imports, reset, and global declarations; 320px, 600px, 900px, 1025px breakpoints.

There's a lot of meaning behind these numbers! Below are the screen widths of some of the world's most-popular gadgets:

 320px - iPhone (4, 4s, 5, 5s)  
 375px - iPhone 6  
 540px - Nexus 5  
 600px - Nexus 7  
 720px - Surface Pro 3  
 768px - iPad (3, Mini, Air)  
 800px - Nexus 10  
 960px - Nexus 7 (Landscape)   
1024px - iPad (Landscape)  
1152px - 2015 MacBook  
1200px - Nexus 10 (Landscape)  
1280px - MacBook Pro 13" (Retina and non-Retina)  

Notice that up to 1024px, a device could be a tablet (with the exception of the Nexus 10), hence the 1025+ desktop breakpoint, which is primarily for restricting :hover effects to mouse-and-keyboard computers.

Jatsby comes with some neat, free-to-use fonts that you can @import locally and via Google Fonts for easy implimentation.
