The Jatsby Web Framework
========================
Jatsby is a minimalist CSS framwork for creating elegant webpages and experimenting with your latest designs. When you have an idea for a button, simply open index.html and jatsby.css and start coding! All the necessities are already there.

Breakpoints
------------
jatsby.css includes four simple breakpoints for making your website responsive. And if responsive isn't on the agenda, simply stick to the mobile breakpoint.

mobile: 300px- 599px
tablet: 600px- 899px
tablet-wide: 900px-1200px
desktop: 1201px+

There's a lot of meaning behind these numbers! Below are the screen widths of some of the world's most-popular gadgets:

 320px - iPhone (4, 4s, 5, 5s)  
 375px - iPhone 6  
 540px - Nexus 5  
 600px - Nexus 7  
 720px - Surface Pro 3  
 768px - iPad (3, Mini, Air)  
 800px - Nexus 10  
 960px - Nexus 7 (Landscape)   
1024px - iPad (Landscape)  
1200px - Nexus 10 (Landscape)  
1280px - MacBook Pro 13" (Retina and non-Retina)  

Notice that up to 1200px, a device could be a tablet, hence the 1201+ desktop breakpoint, which is primarily for restricting :hover effects to mouse-and-keyboard computers.

Favicons
--------
Favicons should be 32x32px in size, and in PNG format (you can use GIF or ICO, but PNG is best and is already coded in index.html!).

Just place your favicon.png file in the same location as index.html and you're good to go!

Final Thoughts
--------------
Remember, Jatsby's in beta! It's not perfect just yet, and it will likely change a lot by the time v1.0 rolls around.
